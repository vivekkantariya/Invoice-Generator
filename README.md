# Invoice-Generator
In this repo i created a Python script using the Tkinter library to create a simple billing application with a graphical user interface (GUI). Allows users to input customer details, product details, and generate bills. The information is displayed in a text area on the GUI. The billing details are also saved to a MongoDB database.
